## 1. The Problem
  * Link State IGP's use SPF
    * path selection is based on cost
    * what if cost isn't enough?
  
## 2. Principles of Traffic Engineering
  * CSPF
  * Where is the state located?
    * Hard state vs. Soft state
  * RSVP
    * roots in QoS
      * resource conflict arbitration vs. conflict avoidance
    * with TE, hosts do not participate in RSVP, only routers
  * IGP modifications
